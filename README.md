# CS5610 | Web Development

Hey! I am Paurav. I am a graduate student at Northeastern University, pursuing my Master's in Computer Science. 
I did my Summer internship at Lookout Mobile Security.
 Last year I also did my co-op at the same place. 
 I developed Ruby web application service at Lookout. 
 The main functionality of the service was to provide integration between Lookout and external MDMs. I was also contributing to another application which mocks the response from the MDMs for test automation. The application was deployed on Heroku. Currently, I am enrolled in this course 
 and thinking of doing a Master's Project under Professor Mirek.
  Which is the same concept as developing a web application 
  to trigger some MapReduce jobs and giving the results to the end user.
  
This repository will have to display my adventure in this course.
  
## Initial Setup
After you clone this repository and run "npm install"
To start the project
Open two terminals, One to start the front end, One to start the backend

~ npm start


~ nodemon server.js

Front end will run on `http://localhost:4200/`
The server will run on port 3100. Specified in server.js and in environment.ts files

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Deployed on Heroku
